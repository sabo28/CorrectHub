# IU Group Project: CorrectHub

**CorrectHub** is a web-based correction management system that enables students and instructors to systematically collect and track feedback, comments, and suggestions for improvement on student submissions.

### üéØ For Recruiters: Context & My Contribution

This repository contains the final source code of my university group project, which received a **grade of 1.0 (A+)**.  
The original development repository, including the complete commit and pull request history, is private and owned by the project lead.

In this project, I was **primarily responsible for backend development as well as creating the frontend prototype**.

**My key contributions included:**

* **Backend Development (Deno, TypeScript):**
  * Designed and implemented the REST API for managing users, submissions, and feedback.
  * Designed the database schema and implemented migrations using Drizzle ORM.
  * Implemented business logic following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.
* **Frontend Prototyping (Fresh):**
  * Built the basic UI components and page structure.
  * Ensured server-side rendering (SSR) for high performance and a smooth user experience.
* **DevOps & Testing:**
  * Set up the testing environment for unit and integration tests (`deno test`).
  * Configured the CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions for automated deployments to Deno Deploy.

### üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Technology Stack

We chose a modern Deno-based stack to leverage native TypeScript support, strong security, and excellent performance.

* **Runtime:** [Deno][1]  
* **Web Framework:** [Fresh][2] (Server-Side Rendering, Islands Architecture)  
* **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL (via [Docker][3]) & [Drizzle ORM][12]  
* **Testing:** [Deno Test][8], [Playwright][11] (E2E)  
* **Deployment:** [Deno Deploy][13] (via GitHub Actions CI/CD)

<summary>üíª Technical Documentation (Quick Start, Tests & More)</summary>

### üöÄ Quick Start

> [!note]
> Make sure all [prerequisites](#setup) are met.

1. Run `make` in your terminal  
2. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser

### Setup

You will need the following tools installed:

- [Docker][3] (e.g. Docker for Desktop)
- [deno][1] (for active development)
- [Node.js][4] (required for running E2E tests)
- [git][5] (optional, for active development)
- [make][6] (on Windows, via WSL or GnuWin32)

### Development Environment

This project is optimized for [Visual Studio Code][7]. The following tools are already integrated:

- [Linting][8]
- [Formatting][9]
- [Type Checking][10]
- Hot Reloading

## Start Development Environment

```bash
make
```

This starts the project in development mode via Docker Compose.
Any code changes are automatically reloaded (Hot Reloading). The app will then be available at:


http://localhost:8000
> [!note] `make` is equivalent to running `make start`, which is turn runs
> `docker compose up`.

## Clean Start

To start the application from a clean state, run:

```shell
make clean start
```

This stops and removes existing containers and restarts the project from scratch.

## Unit- und Integrationstests

To run automated tests:

```shell
make test
```

This command runs Linting (`deno lint`), Type Checking (`deno check`), and the tests (`deno test`).

### Test Coverage

To generate test coverage data:

```shell
make test-coverage
```

Coverage data will be saved to the `coverage` directory.

## End-to-End (E2E) Tests

End-to-end testing is done using [Playwright][11].

```shell
make e2e
```

> [!warning] This will reset the environment
> (`make clean`) before running the tests.

## Database Migrations

Database migrations are handled via [Drizzle ORM][12].
To generate a new migration:

```
make sql NAME=migrations_name
```

## Deployment (Only on the repository from the project manager who is private)

The application is hosted on [Deno Deploy][13] ‚Äì a serverless platform designed specifically for Deno projects.

Deployment happens on two levels:

### 1. Staging-System

Whenever a new Pull Request (PR) is created on GitHub, a deployment is automatically triggered for the staging environment.
This allows changes to be tested in a realistic setup before merging.

> [!tip] The staging URL is displayed directly in the respective PR.

### 2. Live-System

Once a Pull Request is merged into the main branch, the application is automatically deployed to production.
The live version is updated via Deno Deploy and made available under the production URL.
