  note = {Given the Scrum Master's role as facilitator, and mediator between the Product Owner and the Scrum Team, overloading the Scrum Master role with project management introduces a conflict of interest that can compromise the Scrum Master's ability to ensure a balance between the interests of external stakeholders and the Scrum Team: the Scrum Master is supposed to insulate the team and remove impediments, but as Project Manager, he or she would also have responsibilities to achieve objectives set by higher levels of the organization. Stray and colleagues observed that when the Scrum Master is viewed as a manager rather than facilitator, the daily standup becomes a management reporting exercise rather than a team communication meeting}
